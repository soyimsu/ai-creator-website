## Why Use AI for Fundamental Analysis?

Traditional fundamental analysis requires reading extensive financial reports and calculating various metrics — time-consuming and labor-intensive. AI can accomplish this in minutes.

## Preparation

You'll need the following tools:
- ChatGPT or Claude (for analysis and interpretation)
- Company financial data (available from public sources)

## Analysis Steps

### Step 1: Obtain Financial Data
Extract key data from annual or quarterly reports, including revenue, profit, and cash flow.

### Step 2: Let AI Calculate Key Metrics
Input the data into AI and ask it to calculate PE ratio, ROE, debt ratio, and other key indicators.

### Step 3: Trend Analysis
Have AI compare data across multiple quarters to analyze growth trends and potential risks.

### Step 4: Comprehensive Assessment
Ask AI to provide a comprehensive evaluation report, including strengths, risks, and recommendations.

## Important Notes

- AI analysis is for reference only and does not constitute investment advice
- Always combine with your own judgment when making decisions
- Pay attention to data timeliness and accuracy
