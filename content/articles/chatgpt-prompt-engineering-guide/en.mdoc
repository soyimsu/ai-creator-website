## What is Prompt Engineering?

Prompt Engineering is the technique of carefully designing instructions given to AI to obtain more accurate and useful outputs.

## Why Do Prompts Matter?

Good prompts can multiply the quality of AI output. A vague prompt might get a generic response, while a precise prompt can produce professional-grade output.

## Core Principles

### 1. Define the Role
Tell the AI what role it should play, such as "You are a senior marketing expert."

### 2. Provide Context
Give sufficient background information so the AI understands your specific needs.

### 3. Specify Output Format
Clarify what format you want the response in — lists, tables, step-by-step instructions, etc.

### 4. Give Examples
Using few-shot learning, provide one or two examples to help the AI understand your expected output style.

## Practical Example

Here's a before-and-after comparison:

**Before:** "Write me an article"

**After:** "You are a tech blogger. Write an 800-word beginner's guide to AI, using plain language, including 3 practical tips, in a warm and friendly tone."

## Summary

Mastering prompt engineering is an essential skill for using AI tools. Through continuous practice and optimization, you'll discover AI can do far more than you imagined.
